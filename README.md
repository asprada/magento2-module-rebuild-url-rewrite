# Magento 2 Rebuild URL Rewrites

The module adds a CLI which allows to rebuild the following URL Rewrites: `categories`, `products` and `cms-pages`.  
  
It's a fork from [StÃ¤mpfli repository](https://github.com/staempfli/magento2-module-rebuild-url-rewrite) with some improvements to:
  
* **Multiple root category ID for Magento 2 Multistore.**   
  
  Now when you rebuild categories' urls for specified store with a custom category root ID the correct urls are generated.  
  
* **Use SEO configurations fro Admin Panel for products.**  
  
  Now the configuration option `Use Categories Path for Product URLs` is included during rebuilding products' urls.  
  
  When set to `No` the produtct urls with subcategories in its `path` will not be stored in the `url_rewrite` table.  
  
  It's for the performance purpose. It prevent from generating unused urls and the table has less entries for quicker SQL queries.  
  
  Configuration option path: 
  ```
  Admin Panel > Stores > Settings > Configuration > Catalog > Catalog > Search Engine Optimization > Use Categories Path for Product URLs
  ```
